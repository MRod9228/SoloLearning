Just me, a guy with a passion for technology and aiming to become an Automation QA Engineer. Some previous experience using python, java, html, css and well AHK. 
Always enjoyed creating different scripts with AHK to automate processes when I used to believe that java and python were just out of my reach...but not anymore.
Full focus on mastering Python and automation frameworks.
